# MERN Express Generator Project

This is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) project generated with Express Generator. It provides a basic structure and setup for building web applications using the MERN stack.

## Features

- Express.js backend server with routing and middleware support.
- MongoDB integration using Mongoose for data storage and retrieval.
- React.js frontend with components and routing.
- Model-Controller (MC) architecture for organizing backend code.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git`
2. Change into the project directory: `cd your-project`
3. Install dependencies for both the backend and frontend:
   - Backend: `cd backend && npm install`
   - Frontend: `cd frontend && npm install`
4. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory and configure the following environment variables:
   - `MONGODB_URI`: MongoDB connection URI.
   - `PORT`: Port number for the backend server.
5. Start the backend server: `cd backend && npm start`
6. Start the frontend development server: `cd frontend && npm start`
7. Open your browser and visit `http://fayizcj.in` to see the running application.

## Project Structure

This project follows an MC (Model-Controller) architecture for organizing the backend code. Here is the basic structure:

- `backend/` - Contains the backend server code.
  - `controllers/` - Controllers responsible for handling the business logic.
  - `models/` - Mongoose models for defining MongoDB schemas.
  - `routes/` - Express.js routes for handling API endpoints.
  - `app.js` - Entry point for the backend server.
- `frontend/` - Contains the frontend React.js code.
  - `src/` - Contains the main source code.
    - `components/` - React components.
    - `pages/` - Different pages of the application.
    - `App.js` - Main component serving as the entry point for the frontend.
  - `public/` - Contains static files like images, CSS, etc.
